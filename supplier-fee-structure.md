# Supplier Fee Structure

Welcome to the Granular Registry's SSS Module Supplier Access page. As part of Clean Incentive, Inc., we enable utilities and retail suppliers to verify and allocate Standard Supply Service (SSS) attributes, including retired Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), supplier-specific emission factors (SSEFs), and Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) calculations. Our platform supports transparent Scope 2 compliance under GHG Protocol guidelines, with tools to refine public estimates and distribute granular claims to your customers.

Our tiered freemium model balances accessibility with scalable value, especially for multi-state operations. Fees focus on third-party verification and customer allocation services; standard Registry fees apply separately for GC issuance (e.g., enhancing RPS RECs). Verification is handled per state/jurisdiction to ensure regional accuracy.

### Why Choose Our SSS Module Access?

* **Enhance Compliance and Marketing**: Certified CFE and emissions factors position you as a sustainability leader, attracting corporate customers with auditable data.
* **Streamline Customer Allocations**: Automate pro-rata GC distributions via white-labeled portals or direct invites to the Registry, saving time on data collection, calculations, and audits for both you and your customers.
* **Save on Audits and Operations**: Our audited platform handles methodology-driven workflows, reducing your internal expenses while enabling seamless Scope 2 reporting for end-users.
* **Adapt to Granular Rules**: Prepare for hourly matching with verified, time-stamped attributes across jurisdictions.
