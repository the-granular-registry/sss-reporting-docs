# What is Standard Supply Service (SSS)?

Standard Supply Service (SSS) is the default electricity supply you receive from your utility (or a designated supplier) when you do not choose a special program or a competitive contract. Think of SSS as the “default plan” that keeps your lights on without extra steps.

**TL;DR**: If you haven’t signed a special deal (like a green tariff, a power purchase agreement, or bought renewable certificates), you are on SSS. It’s reliable, includes whatever clean energy your utility must provide by law, and varies by region.

## Why SSS exists

* **Universal access**: Ensures every customer has electricity service by default.
* **Regulatory oversight**: Prices and supply plans are approved by regulators, based on planning processes or auctions.
* **Portfolio-based supply**: Your electricity comes from a mix of sources (e.g., natural gas, coal, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar) determined by your utility’s overall portfolio and local policies.

## What you get with SSS

* **A reliable baseline**: Continuous electricity supply without having to shop for a contract.
* **Built‑in clean energy**: Many regions require utilities to include a certain share of renewables or zero‑carbon resources. Utilities usually retire Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) or similar instruments to meet these legal targets on behalf of SSS customers.
* **Consumer protections**: Rates and procurement methods are reviewed or approved by public regulators.

## What SSS is not

* **Not a custom “green” product**: The clean content reflects your utility’s overall portfolio and legal requirements, not your voluntary choices.
* **Not fully opt‑out for policy charges**: Some costs (often called non‑bypassable charges) remain on your bill even if you switch suppliers, because they fund public policy programs (e.g., renewable mandates, reliability, nuclear support) tied to all consumption.

## How SSS relates to clean energy claims

* **Legal vs. voluntary clean energy**: The renewable or zero‑carbon portion in SSS is usually there to satisfy laws (like Renewable Portfolio Standards or Clean Energy Standards). That share is “embedded” for everyone on SSS.
* **Certificates (RECs)**: When your utility retires RECs for compliance on behalf of SSS customers, the environmental attributes for that share are generally not available for separate voluntary claims by individual customers.
* **Making claims**: If you want to claim additional, voluntary clean energy beyond what’s already included in SSS, you typically need extra actions (e.g., buy and retire RECs, enroll in a green tariff, or sign a power purchase agreement).

## How to find what’s in your SSS

* **Your bill or utility website**: Look for “Power Content Label,” “Fuel Mix Disclosure,” “Energy Source Mix,” or similar.
* **Regulatory filings**: Utilities publish plans like Integrated Resource Plans (IRPs) and annual compliance reports that describe portfolios and targets.
* **State or provincial energy office**: Many jurisdictions post annual generation mix and emissions information.

## Regional snapshots (illustrative)

* **United States**: SSS includes whatever mix your state policies and utility portfolio provide. Examples include default service with a mix of natural gas, nuclear, hydro, and growing renewables; in some states, investor‑owned utilities disclose annual fuel mix and retire RECs to meet state mandates.
* **Canada**: Provinces with Crown utilities (e.g., hydro‑dominant portfolios) often have high shares of zero‑carbon electricity in standard service.
* **Europe**: Countries with state‑owned or regulated suppliers (e.g., hydro‑ or nuclear‑heavy portfolios) have SSS‑like tariffs whose clean content reflects national energy policy.

## Common questions

* **Is SSS “green power”?** Not by default. It contains whatever clean energy is required by law in your area. For extra impact or specific claims, consider voluntary options.
* **If I switch suppliers, do I stop paying for policy programs?** Usually no. Many policy‑driven charges are non‑bypassable and remain on your bill to ensure everyone supports shared public benefits.
* **Can I claim the renewable attributes in SSS?** The portion used to meet legal requirements is generally claimed at the utility/portfolio level. To make your own voluntary claims, consider buying and retiring additional RECs or joining a green tariff.

While SSS provides a dependable baseline, its carbon intensity depends on your utility’s overall portfolio and local regulations. To understand your specific mix, check your utility disclosures and regulatory filings.
