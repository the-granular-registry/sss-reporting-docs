# Customer Fee Structure

Welcome to the Granular Registry's SSS Module Customer Access page. As part of Clean Incentive, Inc., we empower energy buyers and users—like corporate sustainability teams and hyperscalers—to access verified Standard Supply Service (SSS) data for accurate Scope 2 reporting. Our platform allows you to view public estimates or unlock certified utility-submitted attributes, including retired Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and supplier-specific emission factors (SSEFs). This supports granular claims under GHG Protocol guidelines, with seamless integration for pro-rata allocations and GC claiming from onboarded utilities.

Our simplified tiered freemium model minimizes barriers for entry while providing value for advanced use. Fees are specifically for SSS module access; standard Registry fees apply separately for any GC issuance or transfers (e.g., from PPAs). If a utility allocates a subaccount or invites you to claim GCs (e.g., from their RPS RECs), we'll waive the standard Registry account fee to reduce friction.

### Why Choose Our SSS Module Access?

* **Streamline Scope 2 Reporting**: Easily incorporate utility default clean energy into your GHG inventory, filling gaps in 24/7 matching.
* **Access Verified Data**: Move beyond estimates to certified, auditable attributes for credible market-based claims.
* **Low Friction for Claims**: Claim pro-rata GC allocations from utilities at no extra cost, including hourly options where available.
* **Scalable and Predictable**: Flat fees ensure unlimited access across states/utilities, with no per-MWh or per-request charges.
