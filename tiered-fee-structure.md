# Tiered Fee Structure

Our third-party verification program empowers utilities to certify their Standard Supply Service (SSS) claims, including retired Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), supplier-specific emission factors (SSEFs), and granular data extensions. This enhances trust in Scope 2 reporting under evolving GHG Protocol guidelines, enabling seamless and automated reports for your customers.

Our tiered freemium model makes it easy to get started while offering scalable options for advanced needs. Whether you're a small utility exploring the basics or a large provider seeking full hourly integration, our structure aligns costs with value. All tiers leverage our robust methodology for estimating SSS attributes from public sources when needed, ensuring compliance and reliability. Fees are specifically for using the SSS module, with third-party verification handled on an annual basis or on a per-verification event basis. For retail suppliers operating in multiple states, verification is conducted (and priced) per state/jurisdiction to account for regional variations.

Note: Converting RPS RECs to Granular Certificates (GCs) and issuing them follows our standard Registry fees (e.g., asset onboarding for wind/solar farms and per-MWh issuance), applicable to utilities, IPPs, or any entity. SSS module tiers do not add extra charges for GC issuance itself—these fees are separate and consistent across the platform.

## Why Choose Our Verification Services?

* **Build Trust and Differentiation**: Verified SSS claims position your utility as a leader in sustainable energy, attracting corporate customers focused on credible market-based emissions reporting.
* **Simplify Customer Reporting**: Unlock tools for pro-rata allocations and customizable reports, reducing administrative burdens for your end-users.
* **Adapt to Granular Accounting**: Prepare for hourly matching requirements with certified data that meets GHG Protocol standards.
* **Scalable and Transparent**: Start free, upgrade as needed—no hidden fees, with clear pricing tied to your retail sales volume and multi-state operations.

## Our Tiered Pricing Model

### Free Tier: Get Started with Proxy Estimates

**Cost: $0**

\
Ideal for utilities testing the waters or in data-scarce regions.\
**Included Features**:

* Automated proxy bundle estimates for SSS retired RECs and SSEFs, derived from public sources (e.g., regulatory filings, certificate-tracking reports).
* Basic annual customer reports with pro-rata entitlement calculations, including uncertainty flags for transparency.
* Access to our data catalogue for self-service insights into energy-market regions.

This tier provides a no-risk entry point, using our proven workflow to generate defendable estimates without direct data submission. Upgrade anytime for certification and advanced tools. (No GC allocation capabilities.)

### Verified Tier: Certified Audit and Core Integration

**Cost: $10,000 base annual fee (or $2,500 per verification event) + $0.002 per MWh of SSS retail sales verified per state/jurisdiction** (e.g., for a supplier with 5 million MWh across two states, total ≈ $30,000/year if annual)

\
Designed for utilities ready to submit their data for independent review and certification.\
**Included Features** (All Free Tier benefits, plus):

* Third-party audit of your submitted SSS data against public benchmarks and our methodology (e.g., REC retirements, non-RPS zero-carbon resources), handled on a state-by-state basis for multi-jurisdictional operations.
* Certified SSEFs and REC volumes, stamped for use in customer Scope 2 reporting.
* Easy API access for customers to pull verified data directly into their systems.
* Annual QA/QC documentation, including Jupyter notebooks for traceability.

This tier ensures that your SSS claims meet quality criteria, preventing double-counting and enabling confident, market-based claims. (GC allocation to customers not included—upgrade to Premium for this functionality.)

### Premium Tier: Full Granular Support and Customization

**Cost: $25,000 base annual fee (or $5,000 per verification event) + $0.005 per MWh of SSS retail sales verified per state/jurisdiction** (e.g., for a supplier with 5 million MWh across two states, total ≈ $75,000/year if annual)

\
For forward-thinking utilities embracing 24/7 carbon-free energy and hourly matching.\
**Included Features** (All Verified Tier benefits, plus):

* Hourly proxy extensions, including time-stamped allocations where available (e.g., using residual-mix factors hour-by-hour).
* Support for converting and allocating RPS RECs as GCs to customers, integrated with pro-rata entitlements (note: standard Registry GC issuance fees apply separately).
* Integrations with customer ESG and sustainability tools (e.g., API hooks for GHG inventories).
* Co-branded marketing materials to promote your verified SSS as a competitive advantage.
* Priority support for region-specific adaptations and stakeholder reviews.
