# Step 6: Synthesize Findings into Final Report and Prepare Presentation

**Objective**: Consolidate outputs from prior steps (e.g., qualified pairs, ETL-loaded data, quality assessments, gaps, and recommendations) into a cohesive final report and presentation deck. This step ensures findings are communicated effectively to the GHG Protocol Secretariat, highlighting actionable insights on public SSS data to influence Scope 2 updates (e.g., integrating granular supplier-specific methods with market-based revisions, per TWG progress as of September 15, 2025, including ongoing consultations on temporal matching and deliverability criteria).

**Key Activities** (Hybrid: Automated DB-Driven Synthesis First, Manual Refinement by Section/Visual):

* **DB-Enabled Synthesis**: Query the database for aggregated insights (e.g., SQL: "SELECT AVG(quality\_score), COUNT(pairs) FROM metrics GROUP BY region"); generate automated summaries (e.g., using Python scripts to export tables/visuals like heat maps of data coverage or bar charts of recommendation priorities).
* **Report Structuring**: Draft a 30–40 page report with sections on methodology recap, key findings (e.g., SSS qualification rates by region), gaps (e.g., <20% EAC granularity in emerging markets), and recommendations (e.g., propose mandatory public SSS disclosures via CDP harmonization; align with ISO 14064-1:2025 for verification). Incorporate multi-perspective views (e.g., industry feasibility vs. NGO equity concerns) and challenge assumptions (e.g., test recommendation viability via scenario modeling: base case vs. +20% adoption post-2026).
* **Presentation Development**: Create a 15–20 slide deck (e.g., PowerPoint/Keynote) tailored for Secretariat discussions, emphasizing visuals (e.g., dashboards from DB), executive summaries, and alignment with Scope 2 core structure (e.g., dual reporting integrity per August 2025 ISB approvals).
* **Stakeholder Alignment and Iteration**: Incorporate feedback loops (e.g., internal peer reviews; semantic X searches for real-time TWG sentiments like "GHG Protocol Scope 2 SSS updates September 2025"); triple-verify content against external benchmarks (e.g., cross-check gaps with IEA Electricity 2025 Report; mathematical validation of coverage stats via sensitivity analysis ±15%).
* **Final Polish**: Address uncertainties (e.g., pending mid-2026 final Scope 2 text); ensure compliance with GHG Protocol standards (e.g., no proprietary data); schedule post-presentation updates based on Secretariat input.

**Output**: Final Assessment Report (PDF, 40 pages with appendices like DB exports and code snippets); Presentation Deck (e.g., PPTX, 20 slides); Curated Dataset Repository (e.g., shared via GitHub or Granular Registry platform); 2-page Executive Summary Memo for immediate Secretariat sharing.

**Efficiency Notes**: Automate report sections via DB templates (e.g., Jupyter notebooks for dynamic visuals) to reduce drafting time by 40%; batch reviews by team roles (e.g., technical for data, policy for recommendations); align with original timeline (e.g., target March 2026 presentation); re-run syntheses post-key events (e.g., December 2025 TWG meetings) for relevance.
