# Step 5: Conduct Gap Analysis

**Objective**: Analyze the quality-assessed data from the database to identify global and regional gaps in public SSS data availability, quality, and alignment with GHG Protocol Scope 2 requirements (e.g., temporal matching, deliverability, and supplier-specific allocation per 2025 TWG proposals). Develop evidence-based recommendations to address these gaps, such as policy advocacy for mandatory disclosures or integration with emerging standards (e.g., ISO 14064 harmonization finalized mid-2025), to inform Scope 2 updates and enhance SSS adoption.

**Key Activities** (Hybrid: Automated DB Queries First, Manual Multi-Angle Analysis Refined by Region/Pair):

* **DB-Driven Gap Identification**: Query the ETL-loaded database for patterns (e.g., SQL: "SELECT region, AVG(completeness\_score) FROM metrics GROUP BY region HAVING AVG < 70%"); categorize gaps by metric (e.g., low EAC granularity in Asia) and SSS category (e.g., Non-Bypassable Charges lacking in deregulated markets).
* **Multi-Perspective Analysis**: Evaluate gaps from diverse angles—technical (e.g., data staleness post-2025 IRA extensions), regulatory (e.g., EU RED III vs. U.S. state variances), and improbable (e.g., blockchain alternatives for EAC tracking); challenge assumptions (e.g., disprove "universal API access" by testing manual fallbacks).
* **Recommendation Development**: Propose actionable solutions (e.g., advocate for supplier-specific mandates in Scope 2 revisions; integrate with CDP for harmonization); prioritize based on impact (e.g., high-emission regions first); incorporate stakeholder views via semantic X searches (e.g., "Scope 2 SSS data gaps 2025").
* **Verification and Iteration**: Triple-cross-check gaps/recommendations against external benchmarks (e.g., IEA World Energy Outlook 2025, RE100 Technical Criteria); perform sensitivity analysis (e.g., ±20% variance on coverage projections); document uncertainties (e.g., pending August 2025 consultation outcomes).
* **Automation & Collaboration**: Use DB dashboards for visualizations (e.g., heat maps of gaps); schedule iterative reviews aligned with TWG milestones (e.g., December 2025 progress reports).

**Output**: Comprehensive gap analysis report (e.g., PDF with tables of regional disparities, scored recommendations); updated DB with gap flags and recommendation metadata; executive summary memo for Secretariat preview.

**Efficiency Notes**: Batch analysis by region/supplier clusters to leverage overlaps (e.g., all EU pairs together); automate initial gap queries to cut manual time by 50%; involve cross-functional team for diverse perspectives; re-run post-key 2025 events (e.g., IEA Q4 releases) for real-time relevance.
