# [Utility Name] Standard Supply Service (SSS) — Case Study ([Year])

> Note: This is a template. Replace bracketed fields and remove guidance notes before publishing.

### 0. At‑a‑Glance Metrics

- **SSS retail sales (MWh)**: [value]
- **Zero‑carbon MWh allocated to SSS**: [value]
- **SSS zero‑carbon share (%)**: [value]
- **Supplier‑Specific Emission Factor (SSEF)**: [value kg CO₂e/MWh]
- **Coverage**: [Annual baseline; Hourly extension optional]
- **Data confidence**: [High | Medium | Low]
- **Data vintage**: [list key datasets and years]

---

### 1. Scope and Definitions

- **SSS**: Default electricity supply under regulated tariffs (or default service in restructured markets). Define legal entity, territory, and inclusion/exclusion of competitive retail or green programs.
- **Proxy Bundle**: Paired dataset of (i) SSS‑retired zero‑carbon MWh and (ii) SSEF for market‑based Scope 2.
- **Zero‑Carbon Resources**: List eligible categories (e.g., nuclear, large hydro, RPS‑backed resources retained for SSS). Exclude voluntary program RECs and externally sold attributes.
- **SSEF**: Utility‑specific market‑based emission factor (kg CO₂e/MWh) after subtracting zero‑carbon MWh.
- **Boundary**: [Utility territory, ISO/RTO zone(s), imports/exports handling].

Provide any utility‑specific definitions (e.g., local riders, non‑bypassable charges, green tariffs) that affect SSS composition.

---

### 2. Data‑Source Inventory

Prioritize auditable, public sources. Replace with utility/state‑specific links.

- **Retail sales**: EIA Form 861 ([Year]).
- **Generation by plant/fuel**: EIA Form 923; utility IRPs/Ten‑Year Plans; FERC/EIA plant data.
- **Emission factors**: EPA eGRID ([latest] baseline, adjusted to [Year]); utility fuel mix disclosures.
- **Compliance mandates and REC retirements**: State commission dockets, program rules (e.g., RPS/CES), DSIRE.
- **Certificate tracking**: Applicable registries (e.g., PJM‑GATS, M‑RETS, WREGIS) for retirements/sales.
- **Corporate reports**: 10‑K/10‑Q, sustainability reports for ownership/REC disposition.
- **Regional planning**: ISO/RTO/BA resource plans; state energy profiles.

List exact citations in Section 7.

### 3. Workflow (Replicable Steps)

Follow these numbered steps; retain numbering across studies.

**Step 1: Define Market Boundary**  
Specify service territory, ISO/RTO status, retail choice/regulated, legal entity, and whether SSS covers all default load or a subset.

**Step 2: Extract Retail‑Sales Volumes**  
Pull total SSS load from EIA 861 (sum of retail sectors). Record method and any exclusions (e.g., opt‑in green programs).

**Step 3: Quantify Compliance Obligations & REC Retirements**  
Determine RPS/CES obligations and actual retirements for SSS. Distinguish compliance vs. voluntary. If none, record as zero and provide confirmation source.

**Step 4: Identify Non‑RPS Zero‑Carbon SSS Resources**  
Enumerate embedded zero‑carbon MWh available to SSS (e.g., nuclear/hydro with cost recovery via base rates, non‑bypassable programs). Exclude resources whose attributes are sold or assigned to other parties.

**Step 5: Assemble SSS‑Retired Zero‑Carbon MWh (Proxy Bundle)**  
Compute:  
SSS_ZERO_C_MWh = RPS_retired_MWh + Eligible_public_asset_MWh − RECs_sold_externally_MWh − Voluntary_program_RECs_MWh.  
Report percent of retail sales.

**Step 6: Construct Supplier‑Specific Emission Factor (SSEF)**  
Use published utility SSEF if available and compatible with Scope 2. Otherwise bottom‑up: apply fuel/plant‑specific factors to residual mix (after subtracting zero‑carbon MWh); include CO₂, CH₄, N₂O. State assumptions and adjustments from eGRID baseline to study year.

**Step 7: Allocate Pro‑Rata Entitlement to Reporting Customer**  
For customer load L_customer (MWh):  
- Claimable zero‑carbon MWh = (SSS_ZERO_C_MWh / SSS_retail_sales_MWh) × L_customer.  
- SSEF applies to the remaining share. Provide a usage example.

**Step 8: Optional Hourly Proxy**  
If hourly data available, apply subtraction per hour to build an hourly residual EF and time‑matched coverage. Disclose limitations if using annual proxies.

**Step 9: QA/QC & Documentation**  
Cross‑verify REC volumes, check no double‑counting, version‑stamp inputs and outputs, archive calculations (e.g., notebook or audit sheet).

---

### 4. Data‑Quality Hierarchy

1. Regulatory filings and official statistical datasets (EIA, PSC/PUC, eGRID).
2. Certificate registry data and utility attestations.
3. Bottom‑up reconstructions with documented assumptions.

State confidence levels and any data gaps.

---

### 5. Region‑ / Utility‑Specific Adaptations

- **Policy context**: [RPS/CES presence, non‑bypassable riders, nuclear ZECs, etc.]
- **Market structure**: [Vertically integrated vs. restructured; imports/exports handling].
- **Voluntary programs**: [Names; REC treatment; explicit exclusions].
- **Fuel mix quirks**: [e.g., heavy nuclear/gas; coal retirements; hydro seasonality].
- **Other**: [Unique local rules affecting SSS composition].

---

### 6. Limitations & Future Work

- Annual granularity vs. hourly claims; availability of time‑stamped residual mix.  
- Treatment of curtailment, imports/exports, and unbundled REC adjustments.  
- Planned updates (annual refresh cadence; policy change monitoring).

## Appendix A — Calculation Skeleton (Replace with actual numbers)

Variables:

- SSS_retail_sales_MWh = [from EIA 861]
- RPS_retired_MWh = [from dockets/registries]
- Eligible_public_asset_MWh = [nuclear/hydro, owned or cost‑recovered]
- RECs_sold_externally_MWh = [utility disclosures]
- Voluntary_program_RECs_MWh = [program documents]

Formulas:

```
SSS_ZERO_C_MWh = RPS_retired_MWh
                 + Eligible_public_asset_MWh
                 - RECs_sold_externally_MWh
                 - Voluntary_program_RECs_MWh

SSS_zero_carbon_share = SSS_ZERO_C_MWh / SSS_retail_sales_MWh

SSEF = (Σ residual_fuel_MWh × EF_fuel) / SSS_retail_sales_MWh

Claimable_zero_carbon_for_customer = SSS_zero_carbon_share × L_customer
```

## Appendix B — Optional Hourly Extension

If hourly generation and residual mix are available:

1. Compute hourly residual EF (by BA/zone if applicable).
2. Subtract hourly SSS zero‑carbon MWh from customer load first, then apply residual EF to remainder.
3. Ensure no double‑counting with voluntary hourly certificates.

Document data sources and limitations for hourly claims.
