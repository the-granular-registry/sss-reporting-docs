# The Meta-Constellation Nuclear PPA and Its Impact on SSS in Illinois

## **Introduction**

In June 2025, Meta Platforms, Inc. and Constellation Energy Corporation announced a landmark 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) for emissions-free nuclear energy from the Clinton Clean Energy Center in central Illinois. This deal, valued for its role in supporting Meta's AI-driven data centers with reliable, low-carbon power, exemplifies how voluntary procurement by large corporate buyers can dynamically alter the composition of Standard Supply Service (SSS) for default utility customers.&#x20;

Under Illinois' Zero Emission Credit (ZEC) program, the Clinton plant's zero-carbon attributes were embedded in SSS through non-bypassable charges on customer bills, thereby reducing the supplier-specific emission factor (SSEF) for market-based Scope 2 reporting. However, the PPA transfers these attributes to Meta starting in June 2027, coinciding with the expiration of the ZEC program, which may potentially increase the emissions intensity for remaining SSS users.&#x20;

This case study illustrates why SSS compositions can change over time due to policy shifts and market transactions, underscoring the critical need for third-party verification and robust data infrastructure, such as the Granular Registry, to ensure accurate carbon accounting.

## **Background on SSS and the ZEC Program in Illinois**

Standard Supply Service (SSS) represents the default electricity offering provided by utilities to customers who do not opt into competitive retail suppliers or voluntary green power programs. In regulated markets like Illinois, SSS often includes zero-carbon resources funded through mechanisms such as the ZEC program, established under the 2016 Future Energy Jobs Act and expanded by the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. ZECs provide financial subsidies to at-risk nuclear plants (e.g., Clinton, Byron, Dresden, and Quad Cities) to prevent premature closures, with costs recovered via non-bypassable riders on utility bills from providers like Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) and Ameren Illinois.brattle.com These subsidies embed the plants' zero-emission attributes into the SSS mix, allowing default customers to claim a pro-rata share in their market-based Scope 2 emissions calculations, as per GHG Protocol guidance. For instance, Clinton's approximately 1 GW of baseload nuclear generation contributes to a cleaner SSEF, historically lowering reported emissions for SSS users by allocating zero-carbon energy attribute certificates (EACs) across the customer base.

The ZEC program, however, is temporary: subsidies for Clinton expire in mid-2027, after which plants could face economic pressures that could lead to retirement without alternative support. This creates vulnerability in SSS stability, as the loss of subsidized nuclear power could replace clean generation with higher-emitting alternatives, such as natural gas, thereby increasing the SSEF and Scope 2 footprints for default customers.

## **The Meta-Constellation Deal**

The PPA, announced on June 3, 2025, secures 1,121 MW of nuclear capacity from Clinton, plus a 30 MW uprate, starting June 2027 and extending through 2047.constellationenergy.comutilitydive.com Meta will purchase the plant's clean energy attributes to match its electricity consumption with carbon-free sources on an hourly basis, supporting its goal of 100% clean energy for data centers and AI infrastructure.constellationenergy.com Environmentally, the agreement is projected to avoid over 34 million metric tons of CO₂ emissions over 20 years by preventing plant closure and fossil fuel substitution.constellationenergy.com Economically, it preserves 1,100 jobs, $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, and enables $1 million in community giving, while facilitating a license extension and capacity expansion.constellationenergy.comdatacenterfrontier.com

Critically, the deal replaces the expiring ZEC subsidies: Meta assumes the financial support previously borne by ratepayers, easing the burden on Illinois utility customers.esgdive.com Constellation executives have positioned this as a "blueprint" for similar arrangements at other Illinois nuclear plants facing ZEC expiration, potentially shifting more zero-carbon resources from SSS to voluntary markets.ans.organs.org While the physical power continues to flow onto the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) grid, providing reliability and low-cost electricity to all users, the EACs are now allocated exclusively to Meta.constellationenergy.com+2 more

## **Impacts on SSS and the Illinois Electricity Market**

This transaction demonstrates the fluidity of SSS: before 2027, Clinton's attributes fall under SSS Category 2 (Non-Bypassable Charges) in the Granular Registry framework, contributing to a lower SSEF for default customers of ComEd and Ameren. Post-2027, the shift to a voluntary PPA removes these attributes from the SSS pool, akin to subtracting "RECs\_sold\_externally" in the Registry's methodology (Step 5). As a result:

* **SSEF Increase:** Default customers may face a higher emissions factor, as the residual mix becomes more fossil-heavy without Clinton's \~1 GW of nuclear (potentially raising CO₂ intensity by reallocating generation to gas-fired plants).
* **Market Reliability vs. Accounting Gaps:** The grid benefits from continued baseload power, enhancing reliability in MISO Zone 4; however, SSS users lose claimable zero-carbon attributes, thereby widening the gap between location-based and market-based Scope 2.
* **Broader Market Effects:** If replicated across Constellation's fleet (e.g., Byron, Dresden), up to 4 GW of nuclear could migrate from SSS, accelerating decarbonization for buyers like Meta while pressuring default service to integrate more variable renewables or imports.eia.govans.org

Without proactive tracking, organizations on SSS might overstate clean energy claims based on outdated data, leading to non-compliance with GHG Protocol standards.

## **Why Third-Party Verification and Data Infrastructure Are Essential**

SSS changes like this highlight the risks of relying on static or self-reported data: policy expirations, corporate PPAs, and market dynamics can abruptly alter resource allocation, invalidating prior SSEFs. Third-party verification ensures transparency and prevents double-counting—e.g., confirming that Clinton's EACs are retired for Meta, not SSS users. The Granular Registry addresses this through its methodology:

* **Public-Source Workflow:** Steps 3–6 quantify compliance obligations, subtract sold attributes, and reconstruct SSEFs using sources like state dockets, utility filings, and certificate registries (e.g., PJM-GATS for Illinois).
* **Hourly Extensions:** For granular claims, the Registry applies time-stamped adjustments (§8), which are crucial, as Meta's deal enables 24/7 matching, while SSS defaults to annual proxies.
* **Data-Quality Hierarchy:** Prioritizing verified filings over approximations highlights uncertainties in transitioning markets, such as Illinois (§5 quirks).
* **QA/QC Safeguards:** Version-stamped calculations and no-double-counting rules provide auditable "credible third-party datasets" for Scope 2 reporting.

Without such infrastructure, default customers risk inflated emissions inventories, regulatory scrutiny, or missed opportunities to procure supplemental certificates via the Registry's Marketplace.

## **Conclusion**

The Meta-Constellation PPA showcases SSS's vulnerability to external factors, transforming a subsidized nuclear asset from a default clean energy pillar to a voluntary procurement tool. While beneficial for grid stability and Meta's Scope 2 goals, it underscores the need for adaptive accounting to accurately reflect these shifts. As a technical expert advising Clean Incentive, I recommend leveraging the Granular Registry for ongoing SSS monitoring, ensuring organizations maintain compliance, optimize claims, and contribute to equitable decarbonization. This case reinforces the Registry's value in an evolving energy landscape, where third-party data infrastructure bridges the gap between policy, markets, and transparent reporting.
